<h1><b>Scalable and Privacy-Aware Distributed Information Processing</b></h1>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify"> 
Graph topologies are important tools for modeling real-world phenomena, such as the topology of the World-Wide-Web, social and biological interactions, or the connectivity patterns in sensor networks. 
As such, modern applications often require processing large volumes of information that is represented in the form of a graph, such as PageRank, a widely used graph algorithm for ranking webpages in search engines, or semi-supervised learning and graph signal filtering, an important building block of graph neural networks. 
Distributed computing provides an effective means of scaling-up large-scale graph processes, by distributing the graph storage and computation load across multiple processors (workers) in the cloud. </p>




<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/graphproc.png" height="190px" style="padding:5px;" />  </p >   


<p style="text-align:justify">However, this also requires extensive communication and coordination between the processors, which can take up to 50% of the overall execution time, making the  </b>inter-processor communication load</b> a major bottleneck in scalability. I design scalable and privacy-aware distributed computing frameworks for large-scale graph and information processing applications, using coding and information theory principles.

<br />

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
Another focus of my research is understanding the information-theoretic performance limits of context-aware  communication networks. 
This is inspired by scenarios in which 
interacting parties are influenced by side information while interpreting the messages, such as external information resources or knowledge bases representing the unique backgrounds, characteristics, or biases. To do so, my research explores the fundamental limits of the amount of information that can be transferred with a fidelity criterion in a multi-user communication network when interacting parties have access to side information.

<h1><b>Semantics-Aware Information Transfer in the Physical Layer </b></h1>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify"> 
Emerging networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are designed to facilitate the interaction of humans with intelligent machines. These networks consist of actors with possibly different <b>characteristics</b>, <b>goals</b>, and <b>interests</b>. Such differences can in turn lead to various interpretations of the received information. I design networks that operate under such ambiguous environments, by leveraging the semantic and social features of information transmission. Unlike conventional communication networks, this necessitates taking into account the personal background and characteristics of the interacting parties. 
For these networks, reliable communication implies that the intended meaning of messages is preserved at reception. 
In effect, this new generation of networks supports interaction at a level that communicating parties can form social relationships and build trust, which may further affect how the received messages are interpreted. 
In contrast, communication protocols that operate in the physical layer do not take into account the difference between the meanings of transmitted and recovered messages, but rather are concerned with the engineering problem of reliably communicating sequences of bits to the receiver. 
These factors together motivate a new approach that molds physical and application layer metrics into one, i.e., a novel performance criterion that takes into account the meanings of the communicated messages. 
I design mechanisms to achieve this, i.e., how to reliably communicate the meanings of messages through a noisy channel. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">An external influential entity, who can influence how the destination perceives the received information, is considered, to model the impact of social influence on how the messages are interpreted. 
The exact nature of the individual, whether adversarial or helpful, is unknown to the communicating parties. 
An individual with such influence capability can have a significant impact on information recovery, hence transmission policies should be tailored to take into account the uncertainty in the intentions of such influential entities. </p >

<h1><b>Heterogeneous Wireless Networks: Interference Management  </b></h1>
<br />
<p style="text-align:justify"> A heterogeneous wireless network is an environment that consists of cellular base stations of <b>various sizes</b>, <b>coverage areas</b>, and <b>operating protocols</b>. Some of 
these are installed and maintained by the mobile operator, such as macrocells (cellular towers), while the others are <b>plug-and-play</b> devices installed by the users, such as femtocells. </p>

<center><img src="images/twotier.png" height="130px" style="padding:5px;" align="middle"/>   </center>  
<br /> 
<br /> 


<p style="text-align:justify">This ad-hoc nature of deployment makes interference management across different tiers a challenge for mobile operators. I addressed this problem in a two-tier network that involves femtocells in addition to macrocells. Mobile user devices as well as base stations are deployed with multiple antennas, which creates <i>spatial dimensions</i> that can be used for interference cancellation or data rate increase. To alleviate cross-tier interference, interference received from the macrocell users can be aligned in a small dimensional subspace at multiple femtocells, while simultaneously ensuring that the performance requirements of the macrocell users are satisfied. This can enable coexistence with high data rates even at very high interference levels, when communication would be impossible otherwise.
